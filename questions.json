        "explanation": "A Mirror Site is considered the most expensive and extensive IT risk mitigation strategy because it involves maintaining a complete replica of the primary site, including all servers, data, applications, and infrastructure. This means that in the event of a disaster or outage, the mirror site can take over operations with minimal downtime and data loss, as it is continuously updated to reflect the current state of the primary site. Here's a brief overview of the other options for context: Hot Site: A hot site has all the necessary hardware and software to resume operations quickly, but it may not have the most current data if backups are not performed in real-time. It is less expensive than a mirror site but still costly. Warm Site: A warm site has some hardware and may have partial data, but it requires additional setup and data restoration before it can be fully operational. It is less expensive than a hot site. Cold Site: A cold site provides only the basic infrastructure (like power and water) and requires the most time and effort to become operational after a disaster. Thus, the mirror site represents the highest level of preparedness and investment in IT risk mitigation strategies."
